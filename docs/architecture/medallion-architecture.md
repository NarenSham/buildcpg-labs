# Medallion Architecture

## Overview
The **Medallion Architecture** organizes data pipelines into progressive layers to ensure **quality, reliability, and efficiency** in analytics.

### Layers
1. **Bronze (Raw)**  
   Raw ingested data from source systems. Minimal transformation, only cleaned for parsing errors.
   
2. **Silver (Cleaned / Curated)**  
   Data is cleaned, deduplicated, and enriched. Suitable for basic analytics and reporting.
   
3. **Gold (Business-ready / Aggregated)**  
   Fully transformed data optimized for dashboards, ML, and advanced analytics.

## Principles
- **Incremental processing:** Each layer adds value without overwriting prior stages.
- **Traceability:** Easy to trace data lineage from Gold → Silver → Bronze.
- **Reusability:** Models at Silver and Gold layers can be shared across multiple labs.

## Benefits
- Reduces data quality issues downstream.
- Enables faster experimentation and analytics.
- Facilitates modular ETL development in a multi-lab environment.
